Shut The Box 0.4
Written by Craig Maloney

A simple dice diversion for one player.

The object is simple. "Shut The Box" by rolling dice and clicking on the
numbers that add up to the dice roll until there are no more tiles to click.

This is an initial release of this code. Yes, it's not the best code, and
contains a lot of "learning curves". Patches and suggestions are appreciated!
:) 

In the future I'd like to implement a "hint" system.
Also some other forms of scoring, and different variatons of
the game would be nice. 

Let me know what you think. Send me e-mail: craig@decafbad.net.

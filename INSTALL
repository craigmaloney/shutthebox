You must have the following installed:

* gtk+ 2.x. 
* glib 2.x.

To compile, change the makefile (if needed) and then issue the command "make".
It should compile out-of-the-box on most systems.

To install, type "make install", and it will copy the binary into /usr/local/bin by default.

To run, simply type 'shutbox' and enjoy.
